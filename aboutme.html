  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Hi, I'm John! I've always loved computers, but I've spent the majority of my career as a technical recruiter
    which is where my interest in software engineering really grew. I love weightlifting and fitness, mixed martial
    arts, video games, movies, books, and breweries. I'm about to begin my software engineering journey with Rithm
    School, so this is my first attempt at building a website from scratch --
    enjoy!
  </p>

  <p>If you'd like to see what my career has looked like up until this point feel free to check out my resume <a href="Current Resume.pdf">here.</a></p>
